FA-React uses a component-based architecture with organized styles:

- **UI Components**: Reusable UI elements (cards, navigation, etc.) in `src/components/ui/`
- **Pages**: Main site pages in `src/components/pages/`
- **Styles**: CSS modules and global styles for maintainability and scalability
- **Accessibility**: ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and skip links

## Key Features Implementation

- **Power Room**: Compare characters from different universes with visual stat comparisons
- **User-Generated Content**: Components for creating and sharing fan content
- **Responsive Navigation**: Bottom navigation on mobile, side navigation on larger screens
- **Accessibility**: Skip-to-content links, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation
- **Responsive Images**: CSS for responsive image handling across different screen sizes
- **Media History Pages**: Consistent template structure for all media history content
- **Directory Structure**: Organized file structure with dedicated directories for each media type

## Why FanArcs?

FanArcs was created to address the common issues with existing fan community platforms:

- Overcrowded interfaces with too many distractions
- Excessive advertisements that interrupt the experience
- Poor mobile experience and inconsistent responsive design
- Inconsistent information organization making content hard to find

Our goal is to provide a clean, structured, and accessible platform for all fans, regardless of their device or technical expertise.
